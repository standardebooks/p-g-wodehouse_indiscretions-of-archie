			<p>DEDICATION<br/>

			<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">B. W.</abbr> KING-HALL</p>
			<p>My dear Buddy⁠—</p>
			<p>We have been friends for eighteen years. A considerable proportion of my books were written under your hospitable roof. And yet I have never dedicated one to you. What will be the verdict of Posterity on this? The fact is, I have become rather superstitious about dedications. No sooner do you label a book with the legend⁠—</p>
			<p>TO MY<br/>
			BEST FRIEND<br/>
			X<br/>
			than X cuts you in Piccadilly, or you bring a lawsuit against him. There is a fatality about it. However, I can’t imagine anyone quarrelling with you, and I am getting more attractive all the time, so let’s take a chance.</p>
			<p>Yours ever,<br/>
